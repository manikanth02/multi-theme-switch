#  Multi-Theme React App

Hey there! 
This is a React app I built theme switching using **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and the **Context API**. It also uses **React Router** for navigation and fetches products from the FakeStore API just to keep things realistic. No big UI libraries like MUI or AntD â€” I wanted to keep everything lightweight and custom.

##  Features

- Three themes to try out (Light, Dark Sidebar, and a playful one)
- Theme stays saved even after refreshing the page (Used `localStorage`)
- Simple and smooth animations when switching themes
- Fully responsive â€” works well on mobile and desktop
- Theme state is managed using Reactâ€™s Context API
- Pages: Home, About, Contact, and a fallback 404 page
- Data fetched from https://fakestoreapi.com/products
- Built completely using **TypeScript**
- No unnecessary UI frameworks â€” just raw Tailwind and React
